Greetings Officer, I am Admiral Kern
Due to your performance in the officer training program, you have been selected to take up the mantle
of Captain on our newest Overlord-Class Battleship. It will serve as a glorious flagship of the 5th Fleet.

There are a few steps to take, before you can step on board though. Do not worry, this will not take long.
Just fill out this digital registration form, and after that, we will get to name our new Beauty.
